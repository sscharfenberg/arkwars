# TODO

## General

- [ ] Find a new name -.- Apparently there is an iOS game called Arkwars with conquering planets and shooting spaceships. Meh.

## Backend
- [ ] scaffold game screens
- [ ] find a simple way to make binary (/multiple?) stars possible, just because its cool.
- [ ] game not active: make all features visible but disabled?

## Frontend
- [ ] PostCSS currently not working, probably a vue-loader issue? https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader/issues/1160
