# TODO

## General

- [ ] Find a new name -.- Apparently there is an iOS game called Arkwars with conquering planets and shooting spaceships. Meh.

## Backend
- [ ] scaffold game screens
- [ ] debug and test manage games stuff. shits important, yo.
- [ ] find a simple way to make binary (/multiple?) stars possible, just because its cool.
- [ ] Changes to Database does not restart the server.cron task; this means we need to look for all games and check for dueDates.

## Frontend

- [ ] Refactor webpack config: bundle-buddy / bundle-analytics
