- [ ] scaffold game screens
- [ ] debug and test manage games stuff. shits important, yo.
- [ ] find a simple way to make binary (/multiple?) stars possible, just because its cool.
- [ ] make values for progressbar dynamic from server (probably together with frontend push)
- [x] improve seed database scripts by using server handlers. half done, needs work.

## Frontend
