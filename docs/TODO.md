# TODO

## General

- [ ] Find a new name -.- Apparently there is an iOS game called Arkwars with conquering planets and shooting spaceships. Meh.

## Backend
- [ ] improve setup / rollback of player systems.
- [ ] setup: colony is already done, create middleware for setup, add destroyer shipyard, add base shipClasses
- [ ] withdraw: create rollback middleware: remove harvesters, pdus, stars, shipyards, shipclasses etc. 
- [ ] scaffold game screens
- [ ] find a simple way to make binary (/multiple?) stars possible, just because its cool.
- [ ] game not active: make all features visible but disabled?

## Frontend
