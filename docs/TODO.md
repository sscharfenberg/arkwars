# TODO

## General

- [ ] Find a new name -.- Apparently there is an iOS game called Arkwars with conquering planets and shooting spaceships. Meh.

## Backend
- [ ] find a way to score planets and sort planets by score, so we can decide on the best planet for the starting colony. array.reduce() probably.
- [ ] scaffold game screens
- [ ] find a simple way to make binary (/multiple?) stars possible, just because its cool.
- [ ] game not active: make all features visible but disabled?

## Frontend
- [ ] visualize population. create modal with slider for food consumption and show corresponding population growth.
