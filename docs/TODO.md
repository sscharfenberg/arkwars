# TODO

## General

- [ ] Find a new name -.- Apparently there is an iOS game called Arkwars with conquering planets and shooting spaceships. Meh.

## Backend
- [x] improve seed database scripts by using server handlers. half done, needs work.
- [ ] scaffold game screens
- [ ] externalize cron/turn handling into a seperate node process.
- [ ] debug and test manage games stuff. shits important, yo.
- [ ] find a simple way to make binary (/multiple?) stars possible, just because its cool.
- [ ] make values for progressbar dynamic from server (probably together with frontend push)

## Frontend

- [ ] Add a Frontend framework for game screens. Decide on using React or Vue.
- [ ] Refactor webpack config: changes for framework, bundle-buddy
